    "1. Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc).\n",
    "2. Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.\n",
    "3. Python has a syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.\n",
    "4. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.\n",
    "5. Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.\n",
    "6. Python Syntax compared to other programming languages\n",
    "7. Python was designed for readability and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.\n",
    "8. Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.\n",
    "9. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly brackets for this purpose.\n"
